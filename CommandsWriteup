Permissions
Permissions are grouped by a single level, a command group, and a command name.
A user may excute <COMMAND> in <GROUP> if and only if the user has been assigned (and not revoked) the permission 

Commands

SYSTEM Group:
PROMOTE: Target - the user to promote. Action - a acl permission specifier. Grants the user the given permission spec. Despite the name, this can both assign permissions (+<group>.<command>), and revoke them (-<group>.<command>).
